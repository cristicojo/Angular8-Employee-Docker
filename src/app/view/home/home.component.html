             Business Requirements:
                The HR department in CompanyXYZ needs to build a system for storing and querying employee data.
                The data model they described is as follows:
                    Each employee record has a "last name" and a "first name";
                    The maximum number of characters allowed for those fields is 32;
                    Each employee has a date of birth;
                    Each employee has a direct manager (who is also an employee in the company);
                    Each employee has "salary" (a decimal representation) and "department" (string representation) data associated.
                    The system need to contain the following APIs:
                        An API to store an employee data;
                        An API to retrieve the employee data;
                        An API to update employee data;
                        An API to remove an employee from the system;
                        An API to return the following reports:
                            Obtain the employee who has the biggest salary in a given department;
                            Obtain the manager who has the most "direct" employees coordinated by him.

                Bonus Points:
                    Add another API to bulk upload employees (file upload with a csv, or json containing thousands of employees);
                    Add paging to the employee retrieval API;
                    Obtain the top n best paid employees in a given department;
                    Return another report:
                        The management tree, from the top CEO down to the lowest employees.
